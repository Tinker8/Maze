The Maze is writen in java 1.8 and can be run from command line if the jdk is avaliable.
Requires one argument: filename

Simply navigate your console directory to the same path as the Maze folder then execute 
the file by typing "javac Maze.java" enter then "java Maze filename".
Note filename above is replaced by whichever maze you wish to run.
E.g. "java Maze large_input"

It will then test the specified maze and tell you in the console if it succeeded or failed,
then it will print the maze with all given requirements included.
